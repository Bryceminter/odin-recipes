        <h3>Description</h3>
           <p>If you're looking for flavorful alternatives to mundane breakfast foods, look no further than this perfect chicken and waffle recipe! The recipe, which calls for fresh chicken, homemade waffles, colorful berries, and more is sure to make you and the entire family keel over from carb-aceous goodness.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>The entire spice cabinet! (Garlic powder, Onion Powder, and Smoked Paprika, and White Pepper are my personal must-haves, but do what works for your tastebuds!)</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Berries</li>
        <li>Syrup</li>
       </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li><strong> Buttermilk soak.</strong> Letting the chicken marinate and sit in a seasoned buttermilk bath creates flavorful + moist chicken. My buttermilk brine includes buttermilk, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, white pepper, smoked paprika, and a few squirts of hot sauce.</li>
        <li><strong> Seasoned flour dredge.</strong> After sitting in the buttermilk brine, the chicken will get sopped up and coated in the seasoned flour. This is the big factor that gives fried chicken that signature, crunchy crunch coating on the outside. The flour is also seasoned so that flavor is ensured at every stage prior to the chicken going into the fryer. Seasoning is life, mmmkay!</li>
        <li><strong> Frrry it up!</strong> We're nearly finished. I like to use a deep fry thermometer to ensure that my oil is precisely on point. Itâ€™s one of my trusty kitchen items that I highly recommend having in your arsenal. However, you can use the old school method of inserting the end of a wooden spoon into the center of the oil. If there are little bubbles around it, then the oil is hot and ready. Otherwise, let it continue to heat up.</li>
        <li><strong> Serrrve it up!</strong> Go on and plate up that chicken and waffles. Enjoy!</li>
       </ol>
