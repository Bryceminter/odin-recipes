        <h3>Description</h3>
           <p>Sometimes a solid meal can weigh me down after a long day of classes, so I like to make protein shakes!</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Strawberries, Blueberries, and Blackberries</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Greek Yogurt</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
        <li>Protein Powder</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
       </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li><strong> Base - Fruit vs. Ice:</strong> Start with a base of around 1 cup of ice or 1 cup of frozen fruit. My favorite base is frozen banana, but mixed berries are a close second. Add it right into your high-speed blender.</li>
        <li><strong> Protein:</strong> Next, choose your protein source(s). We typically use multiple protein sources when making a protein shake. For example, you could do a serving of protein powder + a tablespoon of peanut butter. </li>
        <li><strong> Sweetener:</strong> Now, decide if you’d like to add a sweetener. Depending on how sweet your protein powder is or what base fruit you used, you may not need to add one! If you are going to add one, we suggest an all-natural sweetener such as maple syrup or honey. </li>
        <li><strong> Liquid: </strong> Start with about 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup of liquid and add more from there. There’s nothing worse than a protein shake that’s too runny, so start conservatively. Feel free to use any liquid you like such as water, orange juice, almond milk, etc.</li>
        <li><strong> Blend: </strong> Now it’s time to blend it all up! The better the blender, the smoother your protein shake is going to be! If things are having a hard time “smoothing,” this means you need to add more liquid.</li>
       </ol>
